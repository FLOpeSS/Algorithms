1.0 Algorithms introduction

1.1 Algorithms
    An algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.
    The logic is like: input -> algorithm(black box, data manipulation) -> output.

--------------------
Exercises:
1.1-1
    To find someone in a list of contacts, sorting would be easier finding a contact.

1.1-2
    Space complexity. analyzing the amount of memory usage from the given input to the desired output. Depending on the algorithm,
    it may be necessary more memory usage.

1.1-3
    i could quote the linked list. Good for elements append, store differents elements, very versatile. 
    With the weakness being the big usage of memory, comparing to an array.
    
--------------------
Algorithms and other technologies.
You should consider algorithms as technology. For example, you may have the best hardware of the world, though, if your "system"
doesn't run with greats algorithms to operate any kind of task, your "system/program" is going to be slow.
We could quote the insertion sort and merge sort as a comparison, where when starts to have a higher stream of data to sort, the merge
sort algo just perform orders of operation better than the insertion sort, while the insertion sort has a better performance operating low amount of data.

Thereby, we could say that algorithms has a really huge importance in the performance of programs, not only hardware.

--------------------
Data structures -> A way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
No single data strucutre works well for all purposes, and so it is important to know the strengths and
limitations of several of them.

--------------------
Exercises 1.2:
1.1-1 -> Searching on a contact list
1.1-2 -> The hit rate, efficiency

--------------------
1.1-1 -> 
for i in contact list:
    if contact_list[i] == contact:
        return contact
